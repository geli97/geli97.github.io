<h1>showerthoughts</h1>

</p> In simplest terms, a showerthought is a miniature epiphany that makes the mundane more interesting. It’s an idea that offers people a new way of considering details that they might have otherwise overlooked. Showerthoughts can be funny, poignant, thought-provoking, or even just silly, but they should always prompt people to say “Huh, I’ve never thought about it that way before!”

The term “showerthought” comes from the fact that many of these musings occur to people while they’re doing mindless, everyday activities (like showering, commuting, or just staring at the wall while waiting for a customer service representative to answer their telephone call). As such, showerthoughts don’t have to be had while showering… and in fact, the presence of flowing water and shampoo is not enough to make a showerthought. </p>
